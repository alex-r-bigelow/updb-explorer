updb-explorer
=============
A system for exploring bite-size pieces of large pedigrees, specifically designed for the Utah Population Database

Running
-------
For now, there's a lame GUI front end in the precompiled binaries:

[Mac OS X v1.0](http://sci.utah.edu/~abigelow/Downloads/expressionTopology/Mac/expressionTopology_1.0.dmg)

[Linux v1.0](http://sci.utah.edu/~abigelow/Downloads/expressionTopology/Linux/expressionTopology_1.0.tar.gz)

[Windows v1.0](http://sci.utah.edu/~abigelow/Downloads/expressionTopology/Windows/expressionTopology_1.0.zip)

If you'd prefer to run from the source code, you will need to install Qt, Python 2.7, PySide, networkx and clone this repository. The same GUI can then be launched via:

	python updb-explorer.py

Or from the command line:

	python calculateD.py

or

	python vis.py
